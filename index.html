        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at AUTh, passionate about AI, web development, Low Level languages and FPGA.</p>
        <p>My continuous involvement in Math and Physics Olympiads in the last six years has instilled in me a passion in Modern Physics and Mathematics research. I am currently learning General Relativity and Signal Processing.
        <p>If I had to describe myself in three words, I would say: goal-oriented, ambitious, friendly. </p>
        </p>
